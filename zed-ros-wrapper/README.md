# Stereolabs ZED Camera - ROS Integration

This package lets you use the ZED stereo camera with ROS. It outputs the camera left and right images, depth map, point cloud, odometry information and supports the use of multiple ZED cameras.

## Getting started

- First, download the latest version of the ZED SDK on [stereolabs.com](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/)
- Download the ZED ROS wrapper [here](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper/archive/master.zip).
- For more information, check out our [ROS documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/documentation/guides/using-zed-with-ros/introduction.html), our [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/zed-ros-wrapper) or our [blog post](https://www.stereolabs.com/blog/index.php/2015/09/07/use-your-zed-camera-with-ros/). If you want to customize the wrapper, check the [ZED API documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/documentation/API/).

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 16.04
- [ZED SDK **â‰¥ 2.1**](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/) and its dependencies ([OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html), [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads))
- [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl)

### Build the program

The zed_ros_wrapper is a catkin package. It depends on the following ROS packages:

   - tf2_ros
   - tf2_geometry_msgs
   - nav_msgs
   - roscpp
   - rosconsole
   - sensor_msgs
   - opencv
   - image_transport
   - dynamic_reconfigure
   - urdf

Place the package folder `zed_wrapper` in your catkin workspace source folder `~/catkin_ws/src`.

Open a terminal and build the package:

    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    catkin_make
    source ./devel/setup.bash

### Run the program

To launch the wrapper along with an Rviz preview, open a terminal and launch:

    roslaunch zed_wrapper display.launch

To launch the wrapper without Rviz, use:

    roslaunch zed_wrapper zed.launch
